# VinylCutter

**An obsolete "Record Class" Code Generator for C#**


## Overview

[C# 9 now has Record Classes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-9#record-types) use that instead of this project.

## Historical 

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Vinyl_record_LP_10inch.JPG" alt="drawing" width="450px"/>


C# lacks a true "record class", unlike F# or Ruby, which makes simple data class declarations like:

```fsharp
type Customer = { Name: string Name: string }
```

```ruby
Struct.new("Customer", :name, :address)
```

very long...

```csharp
public struct Customer
{
	public string Name { get; private set; }
	public string Address { get; private set; }
	
	public Customer (string name, string address)
	{
		Name = name;
		Address = address;
	}
}
```

even more so when you add methods to return new instances with modified items.

There is a [proposal](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/proposals/records.md) to fix this. However even if accepted, it will be a long time until it is usable everywhere.

**VinylCutter** is a simple code generator to generate the boilerplate for you. 

## Usage

VinylCutter can be installed as a global .NET Core tool with the following command:

`dotnet tool install --global VinylCutter`

which can be run with:

`dotnet records`.

If you recieve an error similar to `The specified framework 'Microsoft.NETCore.App', version '2.1.2' was not found` 
install the [latest runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started-with-dotnet-tutorial).

A number of common use cases are covered in the [Quickstart](docs/quickstart.md).

One or more C# "definition" files are passed in to define the shape of the record class to generate. 

Each record is based upon the name and namespace of each class defined, with read only properties matching every property or field declared. 

```csharp
[With] public class Point { int X; int Y; }
```

```csharp
public partial class Point
{
	public int X { get; }
	public int Y { get; }

	public Point (int x, int y)
	{
		X = x;
		Y = y;
	}

	public Point WithX (int x)
	{
		return new Point (x, Y);
	}

	public Point WithY (int y)
	{
		return new Point (X, y);
	}
}
```

A number of [Attributes](docs/attributes.md), such as the `[With]` used above, can be added to further customize the generated code.

### Generated Code Stability

VinylCutter is still under active development and the generated code surface will likley evolve over time. In particular it likely will align closer to the [proposed generated code](https://github.com/chamons/VinylCutter/issues/27).

### Command Line Arguments

```Usage: VinylCutter.exe [OPTIONS]+ [FILES]+
Generate C# code from record definitions.

Options:
      --stdin                Read record definitions from stdin, not a file.
      --stdout               Output record generated code to stdout, not a file.
  -o, --output=VALUE         Directory to output file to. (Defaults to current
                               directory)
      --extension=VALUE      Suffix to append to each file name written to
                               output directory. (Defaults to .g.cs)
  -h, --help                 show this message and exit
```
